# Phone-Shop 
This is my fourth milestone project that I have done on the Full Stack Software Development course at Code Institute. In this project, the main focus is using Django 1.11.24 and VSCode was used as code editor. I was inspired by [Apple's](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) new web pages, [Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/europe) old website and [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) to build this website. The project is published [here](https://milestone4-django-phone-shop.herokuapp.com/).

## Purpose of This Project
This project is an e-commerce website to sell trending mobile phones from all over the world. Users can easily search for their desired brands that vary at different prices and can choose how many they want to put into a shopping-cart to purchase. 

These are the following sections of the website:
- Home page: As it is the first page that a user gets to see, it contains examples of products that are being sold, examples of smartphone photography, an ad, a testimonial and a section for the call to action of buying a product. 

- Login/Registration Page: Enables users to sign in or sign up to visit the rest of the web pages, besides the home page.

- Reset Password Page: Is supposed to allow a user to reset one's own password.

- Shop Page: The page that contains all products that the website has to offer. A user can add a product from that page to the cart page.

- Cart Page: A logged in user can see the items that he or she has added into the cart, how much the total price is and each chosen product's details, before checking out. 

- Profile Page: Shows the user account's information and order history.

- Logout: Allows a user to sign out of the website

## UX
#### User Stories
- As a user, I would like to know what kind of phones this website sells, even before having to register
- As a user, I would like to see interesting things that I could do with a product from the website and quick examples of good phones
- As a user, I would like to be able to simply search for the keywords that the name or the description of a product contains 
- As a user, I would like to add the items that I am interested in, to a shopping-cart to save them there and see what the total price is
- As a user, I would like to enter the required information for me to purchase a product in a simple way and view the items that I bought with the order information, in an order history
- As a user, I would like to be able to visit the website from multiple devices, such as phone, tablet or laptop
#### Admin Stories
- As an admin, I would like to sign in to the administration panel
- As an admin, I would not like a user to have the ability to edit, add or remove product details from the shop page

## Front-End Design

The overall design was inspired from what I was taught about web designing at Code Institute and an internship that I did, before starting this project, at [The Ambitious](https://www.ambitious-consulting.de/) by Jan Ruthard. 

The colours that I used on the website were white, orange and blue. I wanted to use bright colours that match well together, such as white, light blue and light orange, so that it would give off a positive look on first glance, but still a sense of importance by usind sharp edges on the pictures and boxes and not choosing too light colours. Also, I made the navigation bar of the website simple, without too many links, so that the user is not overwhelmed. My mentor told me that people are used to clicking on the brand name in the navigation bar to go to the home page, so an extra home button was not required.

The font that I used was the default sans-serif font-family, as I found it to be fitting to the website and theme already.

### Features Left to Implement and Unsolved Bugs
- I want to add pagination, so that the items are in different brand categories and can click on arrows to scroll through a list of phones by specific brands. I looked into the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/pagination/), but as it is a lot to take in at once and I don't have much time to finish this project, I am leaving it as a feature to try in the future.
- I made a page for password resets, on which a user is supposed to enter his or her email address to receive an email that links the person to a page for resetting the password however, I only managed to get the email through the terminal, but not in my email inbox. Since I do not have more time to work on it, it is left as a feature that I want to implement in the future. What I tried to do to solve it was to get a Google password for emails from my Google account on the [security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security?rapt=AEjHL4Mps0KBp02VHygwrbuviAPywFDORznFPftIXniGD1tb5dpI0u8nYM9JEKf6lT1RfHcwsLY6aLBlatEFwztsC0KZbf1DzA) and saved it as an environment variable in env.py for EMAIL_PASSWORD, which is in settings.py, but it did not work locally.

## Process 
### Django
I got lots of help to understand Django from the course and spent hours and days researching and asked questions to tutors and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/?eu_nc=1) members of Code Institute. The codes that I learned from outside of the course are indicated in this README.md file, below.

I was able to use and understand a lot of what has been taught at Code Institute, but I spent loads of time trying to figure out how to make things, which were not shown in the course, work too. One of those challenges was to create an order history on the profile page from the accounts app. 

At first, I asked a tutor from Code Institute lots of questions to understand things to tackle this challenge better. So, I tried the following:

```python
test = get_object_or_404(OrderLineItem, pk=1)
print(test.quantity, test.product.name, test.product.price)
return render(request, "profile.html", {"test": test, "profile": user})
```

In the code above, I wanted to get each primary key of the OrderLineItem and print some of the required information. But, I could not grab everything that I needed from that model. 

So, after research and talking to tutors from Code Institute again, explaining more of what I was trying to do. My next try was the following:

```python
if request.user.is_authenticated:
    orders = BuyProduct.objects.filter(user_account=request.user)

    for order in orders:
        history = order.lineitems.all()
        print(history.quantity, history.total, history.product.price)

     return render(request, 'profile.html', {"profile": user,
                                            "history": history,
                                            "orders": orders,
                                            })
```

At that point, I thought I had it, because this print statement was printing out the querysets, and the orders were working fine in the templates, but the problem was that the history variable was only available inside of the for loop and only showed each queryset, so it did not show up in the templates. I tested it by printing the same print statement, which I have in that code, outside of the for loop, but it was empty. 

Therefore, I needed to append `history = order.lineitems.all()` to a list outside of the for loop and I failed trying the following code:
```python
    history = []
    for order in orders:
        history.append(order.lineitems.all())
```
This code returned querysets again. So, I tried various other ways of looping through the information below. 

```python

    with open('views.py','r') as f:
            for order in f.orders:
                history = order.lineitems.all()
                break
            
        print(history)
```
I learned about this code, above from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25406399/python-get-variable-outside-the-loop), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp) and [Reading and Writing files in Pure Python Documentation](https://python4mpia.github.io/pure_python/files.html)

Someone from the course, on Slack, who seems to often help students, told me to try the following type of for loop, so I googled it, trying to understand it and this is what I did:

```python
for i, c in enumerate(history):
        print(c.product.name)
        print(i, c, type(c))
    print(history.value_list())
```
This printed each queryset next to its index number. So, I still could not correctly get the information from the queryset in the template. Then, I showed it to a tutor from Code Institute again, who told me that I have to loop through it twice to get the correct details and explained me things about querysets. It worked and this is what the function looked like at that point.

```python
@login_required
def user_profile(request, pk=None):
    """The user's profile page"""
    user = User.objects.get(username=request.user.username, email=request.user.email, pk=pk)

    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        orders = BuyProduct.objects.filter(user_account=request.user)

        history = []
        for order in orders:
            for lineitem in order.lineitems.all():
                history.append(lineitem)
        print(history)
        
    else:
        user = request.user
    
    context = {"profile": user, "orders": orders, "history": history}

    return render(request, 'profile.html', context)

```
Although it printed out the correct details and I could show the right information on the profile page in the templates, I could not show orders and history within the same for loop in Jinja2. I tried using zip or nesting the two for loops and then using an if statement, like so:  
```html
{% for info in orders %}
    {% for purchase in history %}
        {% if forloop.counter == forloop.parentloop.counter&}
            <!-- Code goes here in profile.html -->
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```
However, this only increased the number of times a previously purchased item was bought by 1, after every other purchase was made. The idea for using zip came from a Stack Overflow page. Click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2415865/iterating-through-two-lists-in-django-templates) to visit that page. The Stack Overflow page that inspired me for the for loops and if statement in the template can be found by clicking [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14841165/is-there-a-way-to-loop-over-two-lists-simultaneously-in-django/14841466). So, I looped through the queryset in the template, instead of views.py and it worked, as I wanted! Here is the final code: 
- views.py
```python
@login_required
def user_profile(request, pk=None):
    """The user's profile page"""
    user = User.objects.get(username=request.user.username, email=request.user.email, pk=pk)

    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        orders = BuyProduct.objects.filter(user_account=request.user)
        
    else:
        user = request.user
    
    context = {"profile": user, "orders": orders,}

    return render(request, 'profile.html', context)
```
- profile.html
```html
{% for order in orders %}
    {% for lineitem in order.lineitems.all %}
        <!-- Code goes here in profile.html -->
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

However, the final problem that I had with was that only one user account could see every accounts history. If any other user bought somethings from another account, they could not see their own history, as it would all be save on the user account that made the very first purchase on the page. Therefore, needed an if statement in the views.py of the checkout app that would authenticate and save a user's ID. 

```python
    order.user_account = request.user
```
Then, I needed to save all of the order information within the if statement, with this line: `order.save()`.

In the search app, another challenge was to allow users to search for products with keywords that target both, the name and description of the product, instead of just its name. At first I tried using two variables to filter them separately in the views.py file of the search app, which did not work correctly. Later, I found out about Q objects and used the [django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/), as assistance to get it to work. Here is the code that I ended up writing, which works:

```python
def search_function(request):
    products = Product.objects.filter(Q(name__icontains=request.GET['search']) | Q(description__icontains=request.GET['search']))
    return render(request, "products.html", {"products": products})
```

### JavaScript
The JavaScript code was written by myself, except for the code that takes the value that is given by the user through input to display the username that one enters above the input fields. I learned how to write that code from the [jQuery API Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/val/). Here is the code that I am talking about:

```javascript
$("input[name = 'username']").keyup(function () {
    let nameVal = $(this).val();
    $('.username').text(` ${[nameVal]}`);
});
```

### Stripe 
As for stripe, I used everything that was shown in the Code Institute course videos and from those videos I got the code for this project. The videos helped me to understand and use it, like it did with Django. But the problem I had with it was that there was no error that occured, if the CVV field was empty. This is intentional by Stripe, so I had to find a way to make an error occur. I tried using `min_length=1` and `max_length=3` in the CharField for the cvv variable in the MakePayment class of forms.py in the checkout app. But, it did not work and the payment was still successful, when that field was submitted empty. 

```python
    cvv=forms.CharField(label="Security Code (CVV)", min_length=1, max_length=3, min_length=1, max_length=3, required=False,)
```

I also tried changing `required=False` to `required=True` in that line of code above and it worked, but then, even if the inputed information in the form was submitted rightly, an error message from stripe occured saying that the payment failed. So, someone on Slack told me to try using the following:

```python 
    cvv=forms.CharField(label="Security Code (CVV)", min_length=1, max_length=3, required=False, widget=forms.NumberInput(attrs={'required': 'True'}))
```

This code now works and the stripe fields, errors and payment work correctly now. 

## Testing
### Manual Testing
- Tried to register with unmatched passwords
    - Test showed the correct error messages
- Tried to login and register without filling in a required field
    - The registration did not work and the correct messages for the empty fields were shown, so the test went right
- Logged in with wrong account information 
    - The correct error message was returned
- Registered and logged in
    - Both tests worked and returned the correct success messages
- Tried to have access to another web page, besides the home page and shop page by clicking on the available buttons before being logged in
    - Each page lead me to the login page, only the home page and the shop page could be viewed, as supposed to
- Scrolled through each page to make sure that the JavaScript on the navigation bars work correctly
    - It worked correctly on scroll on every page
- Tried typing something into the username input boxes of the login and registration forms to check if the JavaScript code correctly picked up the entered values to display the letters above the input fields
    - Tests worked
- Went to the second section of the home page, where phone brand examples are shown, and hovered over the name of each brand to test if JavaScript would display the picture of each phone rightly, depending on which name was hovered on 
    - Tests worked correctly
- Checked if the design of each page looks fine responsively and if it is easy to use
    - Everything looks fine now
- Went to the shop page and tried adding items to the cart page buy clicking on the arrows that appear in the input fields and tried changing the number with a keyboard too
    - Tests worked rightly
- Clicked on the add button without inserting a number into the field of an item on the shop page
    - Field message returned correctly, showing that an input is required
- Clicked on the add button after inserting a number in the input field

    - Each item was displayed correctly with the right product details, quantity number and total price at the bottom 
- Clicked on the checkout button to pay
    - It lead me to the right checkout page and displayed the correct items that were being bought
- After entering the testing information into the fields, (with 4242 4242 4242 4242 as test credit card number and 111 as test security code), I clicked on the pay button
    - It correctly lead me to the home page, showing the correct success message
- Checked if the user's profile information and order history on the profile page would show up correctly
    - Both were rightly displayed with the correct user information and details of each purchased product
- Added an item to the cart page, inserted a number in the input field next to the amend button and then clicked on the amend button to change the product's quantity
    - Test worked
- Added an item to the cart page, went to the checkout page, inserted a number in the input field next to the amend button and then clicked on the button to change the product's quantity
    - Test worked
- Tested if amending an item to 0 on the cart and checkout page would delete an item from both pages, after each of those tests
    - Both tests worked
- Tested if the cart page would display the correct text and remove the checkout button, when there was no item inside
    - Tests worked
- Checked if the correct quantity number showed up, next to the 'Go to Cart' button in the navigation bar, if there were items in the cart
    - Test worked
- Checked if the forms and button for purchase appear on the checkout page, if there is at least one selected product to be bought
    - Test worked rightly
- Tested if the forms and button for purchase on the checkout page disappear if there is no item that has been selected for purchase and checked if the page would say, "No item has been selected to be purchased.", in that case
    - Test worked correctly
- Tested if all Stripe errors would appear correctly, if a false security number or credit card number is inserted or the wrong month of expriy is selected
    - Tests worked, the right error messages appeared
- Checked if all required fields would show an error, if they were empty on submit
    - Test worked correctly, as the errors showed up
- Clicked on the logout button in the navigation bar and checked if it would log out the account and display the correct logout message
    - Tests worked, the account was logged out and the correct message showed up
- Tested the responsiveness of the website through a phone and the Chrome DevTools on desktop 
    - Tests worked well on all device-sizes
### Automated Testing
- Did some automated testing in order to test if all the views in the accounts and checkout apps returned the correct statuses to see if the functions worked correctly
    - All tests worked fine
#### Tests for the accounts app
- Tested if the logout view and its success message work correctly through the test_logout function 
    - That test went rightly
- Tested the forms of the accounts app to see, if the email, username, password1 and password2 were validated correctly in the registration

    - Tests run well

## Environment and Configuration Variables
#### Local Variables
The local variables that are in the env.py file for this project are, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE`, `STRIPE_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `HOSTNAME`, `SECRET_KEY`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD` and `DEVELOPMENT`. These have the values that are used in the settings.py file that are supposed to remain secret. 

#### Heroku Configuration Variables
The configuration variables that are on Heroku are, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DEVELOPMENT`, `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, `HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_IVORY_URL`, `HOSTNAME`, `SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE`, `STRIPE_SECRET`. The `DEVELOPMENT` variable is set to 1, while I am working on it, but it is set to 0 when submitting the project, after working on it. The difference between the Heroku configuration variables are the `HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_IVORY_URL` and the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` are not needed locally, so they are not in the env.py file

## Deployment and Publishing 
### Start A Virtual Environment on VSCode
- `python3 -m venv myvenv`
- `virtualenv venv`
- `virtualenv venv --system-site-packages`
- `source venv/bin/activate`

### Deployment to Github
- `git init` (to create a new Git repository)
- `git add .`
- `git status`
- `git commit -m "a short description of the update"`
- `git remote add origin `
- `git push origin master`

### Heroku Deployment
- Use the following command:
    - `heroku login`
    - Enter email address and password
- Install gunicorn for running the application on the server
- I used the following to command to create this project on Heroku, as I am in the EU
    - `heroku create milestone4-django-phone-shop --region eu`
- To set up a database, go to the Heroku page, under 'Resources' and add Heroku Postgres in add-ons or use the following command:
    - `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
- Get the DATABASE_URL in the configuration variables or through the `heroku config` commang, and copy it
- Put it into the env.py file, as in os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://---")
- Also do that to SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, so add those into the heroku configuration variables and the env.py file
- Use the following command to install django database URL, which allows to parse database URLs
    - `sudo pip3 install dj-database-url`
- Use the following command to connect to a PostgresSql database
    - `sudo pip3 install psycopg2-binary`
- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` (Tells Heroku what installations were are required)
- import dj_database_url in settings.py
- Switch DATABASE to postgresSQL in settings.py
- Migrate the existing migrations to the postgres database, (use the following command: `python3 manage.py migrate`)
- On the Heroku website, in the project, under 'Deploy', conntect Github, find the repository to the project and click on the button that enables automatic deployment
- For the website to work on Heroku, the statics must be disabled, through `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
- Repeat the steps to deploy to github by using all the same commands, except for `git init`

### Installing and Using Coverage
- `sudo pip3 install coverage`
- `coverage run --source=app_name manage.py test` (Runs tests)
- `coverage report` (Shows how much code has been tested)
- `coverage html` (Gets the index.html page generated from coverage)
- Display the HTML page to see the parts of an app that have and have not been tested

### Amazon Web Services
- Once logged in, choose S3 
- Untick all checkboxes in 'Set Permissions'
- Open the bucket
- Go to 'Properties' and then 'Static website hosting'
- Click on 'Use this bucket to host a website' and insert 'index.html' and 'error.html'
- Click on Permissions, then CORS configuration
- Write the following code in it:
```html
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
- Click on Bucket Policy
- Write in the following code:
```javascript
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[{
      "Sid":"PublicReadGetObject",
        "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- Replace `example-bucket`, in the code, with name of the bucket (Given above the code box)
- Go to the dashboard of 'IAM', which is in the list of selections that appears, when clicking on the pin icon in the navigation bar, 
- Click on groups to create a group
- Click on Policy and Create a new policy
- Click on Import managed policy
- Search for s3 and choose AmazonS3FullAccess
- In JSON, change the string from 'Resource' to a list and add ["arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name"], ["arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"]
- Click on the Review Policy button and give it a name, such as bucket-name-policy
- Go to the created group, go to 'Permissions', search for the policy just created, check it and click on the 'Attach policy' button
- Click on Users in the side-navigation-bar, then click on 'Add User' and name it with something that is associated with the bucket name and tick 'Programmatic Access'
- Choose the created group, skip the keys, as they are not needed and create the user
- It is very important to make sure to download the .csv, as it has the access keys needed in the software and it is important to keep them safe because one is never able to generate them again, otherwise a new bucket needs to be created
- Go back to S3, click on the bucket and test it by trying to upload a file
- The image should have a link that can be accessed from anywhere

## Change the code for S3
- `sudo pip3 install django-storages`
- `sudo pip3 install boto3 `
- Include 'storages' to INSTALLED-APPS in settings.py

- For AWS to save the static and media folders, the following content needs to be added to the custom_storages.py file:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

And this code below must be added to the settings.py file for it to work:

```python
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000'
}

AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'django-ecommerce-rian'
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")

AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = '%s.s3.amazonaws.com' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME

STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = 'https://%s/%s/'%(AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN, MEDIAFILES_LOCATION)
```
